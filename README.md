## About

Here you will find an index that will take you through most of my projects, challenges, articles, and other related things that I might have worked on or will work in the future.

### Useful for reading
 * Along the short description of projects, you will find two small icons.
   - 游녻 It's a personal project, performed solo.
   - 游논 It's a collaborative project, where I either worked with other people in pair programming during development, design or testing.
  
  Each project has a ReadMe file with more information about this. In any case, you can always contact me directly.
